          <h2>A Basic Primer on Chaz</h2>

          <p>I would like to introduce myself. My name is Chaz and I am a software developer. I grew up in the Renton area near Seattle. As you might imagine that means that I have grown up with a lot of rain and very little snow. While the summer is nice I really appreciate a nice Seattle grey day staying inside and watching some garbage television, or getting some pho comfort food. Sadly pho is never as good as take-out but what are you going to do in the current times.</p>
