          <h2>A Basic Primer on Chaz</h2>

          <p>I would like to introduce myself. My name is Chaz and I am a software developer. I grew up in the Renton area near Seattle. As you might imagine that means that I have grown up with a lot of rain and very little snow. While the summer is nice I really appreciate a nice Seattle grey day staying inside and watching some garbage television, or getting some pho comfort food. Sadly pho is never as good as take-out but what are you going to do in the current times.</p>

          <h2>My Goals</h2>

          <p>My goals and the reason why I am at code fellows are not anything wildly unique.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Continue to grow as a software developer</li>
            <li>Honestly a high paying job, not going to lie</li>
            <li>Get a house with a yard for a dog</li>
            <li>Go backpacking at least once this year</li>           
          </ol>

          <p>They are some simple plans but they are mine. And I am excited to keep moving forwards to them.</p>
